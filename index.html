    <h1>Welcome to the official website of the State of Zabytykh.</h1>
    <p>We are a proud part of the Cyro-Zabytykhi Republic, along with the State of Cyronia, State of Melgar, State of Piona and the State of the Achterhoek.</p>
    <p>Currently, we handle international and foreign affairs, including those concerning the CyZa-USD Pact while our Sister State, Cyronia, controls most internal affairs.</p>
    <p>If you have any questions, please directly speak to the Cyro-Zabytykhi Republic Department for External Affairs (CYDEA) in the Map of Toulmond Discord.</p>
    <h2>Our Stance</h2>
    <p>We strive to keep a relatively neutral attitude towards the politics of Toulmond. This will be prioritzed. However, if we must, we will participate in conflicts. These include conflicts instigated by other nations on the USD.</p>
