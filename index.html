      <h2>SLF Advance</h2>
      <h4>By the Cyro-Zabytykhi Republic Government</h4>
      <p><sub>23:00 22/11/2024 UTC</sub></p>
      <p>
        The Sautican Liberation Force has initiated <strong>Operation Golden Swan/Liberation</strong>. 
        <br>
        Northern Philistine, Southern Canaan and eastern Ardentis is being stormed 
        by military from across Toulmond while rebel groups continue to fight guerilla wars with the local army.

      <h2>Use of Gas by Zabytykh?</h2>
      <h4>By First Correspondant Iosef Hanson</h4>
      <p><sub>00:32 23/11/2024 UTC</sub></p>
      <p>
        The Zabytykhi Government has confirmed the use of chemical warfare in Israeli mainland and Samaria, but no official figures as of now whether there has been casualties.

      <h2>Potential Use of Alpha-Centauri</h2>
      <h4>By First Correspondant Iosef Hanson</h4>
      <p><sub>10:27 23/11/2024 UTC</sub></p>
      <p>
        The Zabytykhi Government, at this second, is inquiring the Zabytykhi State Department for Nuclear Weapons Usage (ZSDNWU) of whether the use of Aluyde missiles 
        on Canaanite mainland for the sake of Sautica can be justified. We will bring to you more news when we have it.

      <h2>Voidance of Suni Advance by Canaan?</h2>
      <h4>By DeepDive Expert Kori McKee</h4>
      <p><sub>10:44 23/11/2024 UTC</sub></p>
      <p>
        After examining the current situation, our experts at DeepDive have come to the conclusion that the Federal Republic of Canaan, as well as Ardentis and Philistine, has voided 
        the major Suni advance into "their" land. The difference between Suni's post (Sautican liberation update, posted ~3:00 UTC) and Canaan's post (Tahila Canaan, posted ~6:00 UTC) 
        exists a large enough time gap to assume Canaan has voided the update. There has been no official explanation, but we have come up with two possibilities:
        <br>
        1. Canaan overestimates their power and "push back" entire Suni advance
        <br>
        2. Canaan ignores the advance because they class it as "unrealistic"
        <br>
        3. Canaan ignores the advance because they did not know it exists (highly unlikely)
        <br>
        <br>
        After more examination, we have defined that it is most likely situation 1.

      <h2>First Glimpse Into Casualty Reports - What do we know?</h2>
      <h4>By Data Analyst Johann Stefens</h4>
      <p><sub>12:33 23/11/2024 UTC</sub></p>
      <p>
        After days of combat, the first casualty reports have been sent to us via an anonymous source. It has been split into Canaan, Upper Canaan, Seloe, Raduzruna, Semaria, 
        Philistine, and Ardentis (in no specific order). While the 532,000 casualties from the SLF in Ardentis were expected, it is surprising to see heavy losses in both Canaan and 
        Raduzruna.

      <h2>Further March Into All Fronts</h2>
      <h4>By First Correspondant Iosef Hanson</h4>
      <p><sub>14:49 23/11/2024 UTC</sub></p>
      <p>
        While the Battle of Jerusalem rages on with the Silver Legion in Canaan, Zabytykhi and Texan forces continue to march deep into Sautican land, 
        with over a quarter of Ardentis under Allied occupation. Some maps from Canaan are also voided and non-canonised, while we continue to penetrate their so-called 
        "United Democracy Forces". Resistance has been significantly reduced as well, after missile strikes targeting Canaanite and Philistinian military complexes were proven successful.

      <h2>Rejection of the use of Alpha-Centauri and Activity From Missile Silos</h2>
      <h4>By First Correspondant Iosef Hanson</h4>
      <p><sub>17:59 23/11/2024 UTC</sub></p>
      <p>
        After careful consideration by the Zabytykhi State Department for Nuclear Weapons Usage, the proposal to use Aluyde missiles in a more broad description has been prohibited 
        as the Department claims "Fertile land will pay the price of this liberation" if the Order was permitted. Despite the prohibition, multiple missile silos - 30 at least - in Zone 2 
        have been seen to go live, aiming at Canaanite lands, mostly at military structures but also some at strategic docks and ports. The missiles used in these silos, according to 
        experts, are expected to be nuclear capable (MLR-44, ATAB-9 (Air-to-Air Ballista), HOSTAM (Homing Surface-to-Air Missile) and other variants) and/or incendiary bombs 
        (MERICA (Medium Range Incendiary Cluster Advanced), MRIC-29 (Medium Range Incendiary Cluster), LORADIC (Long Range Area Denial Incendiary Cluster) 
        and other variants of the LRN-10 (Long Range Napalm)).

      <h2>Sieging of Jerusalem</h2>
      <h4>By the CIF State Government</h4>
      <p><sub>22:34 25/11/2024 UTC</sub></p>
      <p>
        The Siege of Jerusalem is now underway with the Steel Line surrounding the District of Jerusalem in 3 rings, and heavily patrolled seas and airspaces. Any aid to the city is now 
        only available through limited airdrops and naval support, while terrestrial aid, or attempts of it, will be shot on site by permanently armed personnel.
